# WeatherBot
My program prompts the user for a city and then it gives them the skies, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the country of the city. If the city the user gives is a valid city a picture of a dog from the http.dog api will show that the request has gone through sucessfully with code "200", if the user inputs an invalid city a picture of a dog with code "404" will pop up showing that their is an error
